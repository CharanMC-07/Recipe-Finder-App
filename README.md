# 🍲Recipe Finder App

---
The **Recipe Finder App** is an interactive web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed to help users search for food recipes quickly and efficiently. It utilizes the **MealDB API**, a free and open database of meal recipes, to fetch real-time information about thousands of dishes from various cuisines. The application allows users to search for a recipe by entering a keyword, such as “chicken,” “pasta,” or “egg,” and displays the matching recipes with appealing images, names, and options to view detailed information.

## 📖 About the Project

The project is made up of three main files:

* **index.html** – provides the basic structure of the webpage
* **style.css** – adds colors, layout, and styling to make it look attractive
* **script.js** – handles the logic for fetching data from the MealDB API and updating the webpage dynamically

This project demonstrates how to use an external API, handle asynchronous JavaScript using `fetch()` and `async/await`, and display data dynamically using DOM manipulation. It’s a great beginner project for anyone learning how to build interactive web applications.
